# Unified Messaging

**Unified Messaging** is a portfolio project that demonstrates a unified inbox where users can view messages from multiple platforms in a single clean dashboard.

- **Gmail Integration** with real data (Via Google OAuth2)
- **Secure token handling** and logout
- **Responsive UI** built with React.js + TailwindCss
- **Simulated Instagram and Facebook messages** (For demo purposes)
- **Full stack app** with React frontend + Node.js , Express.js and MongoDb backend

## Live Demo

## Important Note
- Gmail login works with **real data** but since the app is in **testing mode**, you will need to **contact me** to be added to the google test user list before you can login with gmail, however you can login via guest.
- Instagram and Facebook feeds are **simulated** to show intended UI/UX

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDb
